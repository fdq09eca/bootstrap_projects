# Bootstrap projects
## Introduction
This project is a build along project adpoted from [this Udemy course]([www.udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/)). Project objective is getting myself familiar with a front end development framework. 
## Reasons
- My research assistant job nature requires a mild skill level of static webpage development, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the original tool, was adopted by my preceedent for this purpose. 
- However, with the growth of the center, the demand of the website's functionality increased.
The static generator becomes inefficent in terms of editing the content and managing the structure. 
- Bootstrap is prefered in this context because its commoness, ease of alternation and documentation completeness. Moreover, it blends well with backend framework, for example, flask. It is also benefitial for the next RA to pick this duty up easily.
